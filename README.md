## Jupyter notebook on compute node
This script allows the creation of a jupyter notebook on a compute node.

Run the script `jupyter_start.sh` using
```./jupyter.sh```
to start the Jupyter notebook. The script prints out the IP address on which jupyter notebook is being run. The default port can be set up in the jupyter configuration file.
